# system_view

Problem Statement: In R4+ release of ameyo, Supervisor does not have na option to look through the agent activity at system level, and thus have to go through campaign by campaign to get the basic info about agent status. This is not feasible to do so, when we have large number of campaigns.

Proposed solution: 


Deep Dive in the code

// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
